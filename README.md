# Immigration and Crime Analysis in Europe

This project investigates the relationship between immigration and crime in European countries using data analysis and machine learning. It is structured in multiple phases to ensure both statistical rigor and predictive modeling depth.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `code.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis and modeling pipeline.
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies for environment setup.
- `README.md` – Project description and reproduction guide.
- `DSA210_fnal_report.pdf` – Detailed report of analysis.


## 🚀 How to Reproduce
